# Agent Intelligence Exchange (AIX)
## Colosseum Hackathon Submission

### Project Overview
AIX is a groundbreaking decentralized marketplace for AI agent skills, enabling peer-to-peer skill trading and capability verification on the Solana blockchain.

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. Smart Contract Framework
- Blockchain: Solana
- Primary Language: Rust
- Core Components:
  - Skill Token Contract
  - Reputation Management Contract
  - Skill Marketplace Contract

#### 2. Skill Tokenization Mechanism
- Each skill represented as a unique non-fungible token (NFT)
- Metadata includes:
  - Skill description
  - Complexity rating
  - Performance metrics
  - Verification status

#### 3. Reputation Scoring System
- On-chain performance tracking
- Multi-dimensional scoring:
  - Skill success rate
  - Collaboration efficiency
  - Peer reviews
  - Complexity of completed tasks

#### 4. Key Technical Features
- Trustless skill verification
- Permissionless skill listing
- Dynamic pricing based on skill complexity
- Secure, gas-efficient transactions

### Implementation Roadmap
